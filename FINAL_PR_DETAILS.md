## 🗑️ Delete Event Feature

### What's New:
Event creators can now delete their events with proper authorization.

### User Experience:

**Event Creator sees:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  🥾 Mountain Hike                │
│  📍 Lonavala                     │
│  📅 Tomorrow, 9:00 AM            │
│  👥 5/10 joined                  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [🗑️ Delete Event]  [💬 Chat]   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Event Participant sees:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  🥾 Mountain Hike                │
│  📍 Lonavala                     │
│  📅 Tomorrow, 9:00 AM            │
│  👥 5/10 joined                  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [✗ Leave Event]  [💬 Chat]      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Security:
- ✅ Only authenticated users can delete
- ✅ Only event creator can delete their event
- ✅ Backend validates ownership (403 Forbidden if unauthorized)
- ✅ Confirmation dialog prevents accidents
- ✅ Complete data cleanup (event + chat messages)

### API:
```
DELETE /api/events/{event_id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Success (200): {"message": "Event deleted successfully"}
Error (403): {"detail": "Only the event creator can delete this event"}
Error (404): {"detail": "Event not found"}
```
