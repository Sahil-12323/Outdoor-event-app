  - Integrated with AuthContext
  - Toast notifications for delete operations

- **`src/components/EventForm.js`**:
  - Integrated OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
  - Real-time location search with debouncing
  - Expanded popular locations fallback (50+ venues)
  - Better geocoding with OSM

- **`src/components/FreeMapView.js`**:
  - Changed marker interaction from hover to click
  - Added delete button for event creators
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Debounced popup interactions
  - Fixed hover flicker bug completely

- **`src/App.css`**:

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. Hover Flicker Bug ✅
**Problem**: Event markers moved up/down on hover, causing popups to flicker

**Root Cause**: 
- CSS hover effects (`transform: scale(1.1)`)
- Hover-based popup triggering
- Marker position shifts on scale

**Solution**:
- ✅ Removed ALL CSS hover effects from markers
- ✅ Changed to click-to-open popup pattern
- ✅ Industry-standard interaction model
- ✅ Mobile-friendly

**Result**: Zero flicker, completely stable markers

### 2. Limited Location Search ✅
**Problem**: Only ~15 hardcoded locations available

**Solution**: OpenStreetMap integration with worldwide search

### 3. No Delete Functionality ✅
**Problem**: Users couldn't delete events they created

**Solution**: Full delete implementation with authorization

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### OpenStreetMap Integration:
```javascript
// Real-time search with OSM Nominatim API
const response = await fetch(
  `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?` +
  `q=${encodeURIComponent(input)}&format=json&limit=8`
);
```

### Delete Event Endpoint:
```python
@api_router.delete("/events/{event_id}")
async def delete_event(event_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # Authorization check
    if event.get('created_by') != current_user.id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Only the event creator can delete")
    
    # Cascade delete
    await db.events.delete_one({"id": event_id})
    await db.chat_messages.delete_many({"event_id": event_id})
```

### Click-Only Markers:
```javascript
// Stable click interaction (no hover)
eventHandlers={{
  click: () => {
    if (hoverTimeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(hoverTimeoutRef.current);
    }
    onHover(event.id);
  }
}}
```

### Removed All Hover CSS:
```css
/* BEFORE (Buggy) */
.leaflet-marker-icon:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1) !important; /* Caused movement */
}

/* AFTER (Fixed) */
.leaflet-marker-icon {
  cursor: pointer !important;
  /* No hover effects - click only */
}
```
