# Pull Request: Add Delete Event Functionality

## Summary

This PR adds the ability for event creators to delete their own events, with proper authorization and data cleanup.

## 🚀 New Feature: Delete Event

**Users can now delete events they created!**

### What's Added

**Backend (API):**
- ✅ New `DELETE /api/events/{event_id}` endpoint
- ✅ Authorization: Only event creator can delete
- ✅ Automatic cleanup: Deletes event + all chat messages
- ✅ Proper error handling (403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found)

**Frontend (UI):**
- ✅ **Delete button** for event creators (red button with trash icon)
- ✅ **Confirmation dialog** prevents accidental deletion
- ✅ Toast notifications (success/error messages)
- ✅ Automatic UI refresh after deletion
- ✅ Popup closes after deletion

## 🎯 User Experience

### For Event Creators:
1. Hover over event you created
2. See **"🗑️ Delete Event"** button (red)
3. Click button
4. Confirm in dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete '[Event Name]'? This will remove the event and all chat messages."
5. Event deleted with success notification
6. Event disappears from map

### For Other Users:
- Non-creators **cannot see** the delete button
- They see Join/Leave buttons as before
- No changes to their experience

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ **Authorization required**: User must be authenticated
- ✅ **Owner-only access**: Only event creator can delete
- ✅ **Backend validation**: Server validates ownership
- ✅ **Safe deletion**: All related data cleaned up
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper error messages for unauthorized attempts

## 📝 Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/server.py`)
```python
@api_router.delete("/events/{event_id}")
async def delete_event(event_id: str, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Delete an event (only creator can delete)"""
    # Validates creator, deletes event + chat messages
```

### Frontend (`frontend/src/App.js`)
```javascript
const deleteEvent = async (eventId) => {
  // Calls DELETE endpoint, refreshes events, shows toast
};
```

### Frontend (`frontend/src/components/FreeMapView.js`)
- Added delete button UI for event creators
- Added confirmation dialog
- Reorganized button layout for better UX

## 🧪 Testing

**Test Cases:**

1. ✅ **Event creator can delete their event**
   - Create event → Hover → Click Delete → Confirm → Success

2. ✅ **Non-creator cannot delete event**
   - Try to delete someone else's event → No delete button shown

3. ✅ **Confirmation required**
   - Click Delete → Dialog appears → Can cancel or confirm

4. ✅ **Data cleanup**
   - Delete event → Event removed from DB
   - All chat messages for that event also removed

5. ✅ **Authorization enforced**
   - Backend returns 403 if non-creator tries to delete
   - Proper error message shown

6. ✅ **UI updates**
   - Event disappears from map immediately
   - Success toast notification shown
   - Popup closes automatically

## 📊 Button Layout

**Event Creator sees:**
```
[🗑️ Delete Event]  [💬 Chat]
```

**Event Participant sees:**
```
[✗ Leave Event]  [💬 Chat]
```

**Non-Participant sees:**
```
[✓ Join Event]  [🧭 Directions]
```

## 🎨 UI Changes

**Before:**
- Event creators had no way to delete events
- Same buttons shown for creators and participants

**After:**
- Event creators see dedicated delete button
- Clear visual indication (red color, trash icon)
- Confirmation dialog for safety
- Better button organization
