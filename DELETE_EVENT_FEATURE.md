# ✅ Delete Event Feature Added!

## What's New

Event creators can now **delete their own events**!

---

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ **Backend API:**
- New DELETE endpoint: `/api/events/{event_id}`
- Only event creator can delete
- Automatically deletes all associated chat messages
- Returns 403 error if non-creator tries to delete
- Returns 404 if event not found

### ✅ **Frontend:**
- **Delete button** appears for event creators
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Success/error toast notifications
- Automatic UI refresh after deletion
- Map popup closes after deletion

---

## 🎨 How It Works

### For Event Creators:

1. **Hover over your event** on the map
2. You'll see a **"🗑️ Delete Event"** button (instead of Join/Leave)
3. Click **"Delete Event"**
4. **Confirmation dialog** appears asking "Are you sure?"
5. Click **OK** to delete or **Cancel** to keep
6. ✅ Event deleted + Success message
7. Event disappears from map

### For Other Users:

- They see **"Join Event"** or **"Leave Event"** buttons
- **NO delete button** (only creator can delete)

---

## 🔒 Security

✅ **Authorization:**
- Only the event creator can delete their event
- Backend validates user identity
- Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized

✅ **Data Cleanup:**
- Deletes event from database
- Deletes all chat messages for that event
- Prevents orphaned data
