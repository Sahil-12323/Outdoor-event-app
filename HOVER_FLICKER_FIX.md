# 🐛 Bug Fix: Hover Flicker on Event Markers

## Problem

Event markers were experiencing a "hover flicker" bug where:
- Hovering over some event markers caused them to move up and down
- The description popup kept appearing and disappearing rapidly
- This created a jittery, unusable experience

## Root Cause

The bug was caused by a classic hover state conflict:

1. User hovers over marker → Popup appears
2. Popup appears over/near marker → Mouse technically leaves marker area
3. Mouse leaves marker → Popup disappears
4. Popup disappears → Mouse is back over marker
5. **Loop repeats infinitely** → Causes flickering

This is especially problematic when:
- Popups are positioned near the marker
- There's no delay in hover state changes
- Mouse movements are sensitive

## Solution

Implemented a **debounced hover system** with proper state management:

### 1. **Added Hover Delay**
```javascript
const handleMouseLeave = () => {
  // Add 100ms delay before hiding popup
  hoverTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    onLeaveHover();
  }, 100);
};
```

**Why this works:**
- Small delay prevents immediate hiding
- Gives time for mouse to move to popup
- Prevents flicker from small movements

### 2. **Proper Popup Hover Handling**
```javascript
const handlePopupMouseEnter = () => {
  // Cancel hide timeout when mouse enters popup
  if (hoverTimeoutRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(hoverTimeoutRef.current);
  }
};
```

**Why this works:**
- Popup maintains hover state
- Smooth transition between marker and popup
- No gap in hover coverage

### 3. **Immediate Close on Actions**
```javascript
const handleClosePopup = () => {
  // Clear timeout and close immediately
  if (hoverTimeoutRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(hoverTimeoutRef.current);
  }
  onLeaveHover();
};
```

**Why this works:**
- Buttons close popup immediately
- No delay when user takes action
- Clean UX

### 4. **Cleanup on Unmount**
```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (hoverTimeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(hoverTimeoutRef.current);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

**Why this works:**
- Prevents memory leaks
- Clears pending timeouts
- Clean component lifecycle

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/components/FreeMapView.js`

**Added:**
- `hoverTimeoutRef` - Ref to track timeout
- `handleMouseEnter()` - Smart marker hover handler
- `handleMouseLeave()` - Delayed marker leave handler
- `handlePopupMouseEnter()` - Popup hover handler
- `handlePopupMouseLeave()` - Popup leave handler
- `handleClosePopup()` - Immediate close handler
- Cleanup effect for timeout

**Updated:**
- All button `onClick` handlers to use `handleClosePopup()`
- Marker event handlers to use new hover handlers
- Popup hover handlers to maintain state
- Close button to immediately clear timeout

## How It Works Now

### Smooth Hover Flow:

1. **Mouse enters marker:**
   - Clear any pending hide timeout
   - Show popup immediately

2. **Mouse leaves marker:**
   - Start 100ms countdown to hide
   - If mouse enters popup within 100ms → Cancel hide

3. **Mouse enters popup:**
   - Cancel hide countdown
   - Popup stays visible

4. **Mouse leaves popup:**
   - Hide popup immediately
   - Clean state

5. **User clicks button:**
   - Close popup immediately
   - Clear all timeouts
   - No delay

### Visual Flow:
```
Marker Hover → [100ms buffer] → Popup Hide
     ↓
  Popup Hover → Cancel Hide → Keep Visible
     ↓
  Leave Popup → Hide Immediately
     ↓
  Click Button → Close Immediately
```

## Testing

### ✅ Test Cases:

1. **Hover over marker:**
   - ✅ Popup appears smoothly
   - ✅ No flickering
   - ✅ Stable display

2. **Move mouse to popup:**
   - ✅ Popup stays visible
   - ✅ No disappearing
   - ✅ Smooth transition

3. **Quick mouse movements:**
   - ✅ No flicker
   - ✅ Debouncing works
   - ✅ Stable behavior

4. **Click buttons:**
   - ✅ Popup closes immediately
   - ✅ No delay
   - ✅ Clean action

5. **Hover different events rapidly:**
   - ✅ Popups switch smoothly
   - ✅ No stuck states
   - ✅ Proper cleanup

## Technical Details

### Debounce Timing:
- **100ms delay** for hiding popup
- Short enough to feel responsive
- Long enough to prevent flicker
- Optimal for mouse movement patterns

### Timeout Management:
- Uses `useRef` for timeout reference
- Doesn't cause re-renders
- Properly cleaned up
- No memory leaks

### Event Priority:
1. **Immediate**: Button clicks, close button
2. **Fast**: Mouse enter popup
3. **Delayed**: Mouse leave marker

## Benefits

1. **No More Flickering:**
   - Stable hover states
   - Smooth transitions
   - Professional UX

2. **Better Performance:**
   - Reduced re-renders
   - Efficient timeout management
   - Clean memory usage

3. **Improved UX:**
   - Predictable behavior
   - Easy to use
   - No frustration

4. **Maintainable Code:**
   - Clear intent
   - Proper cleanup
   - Well-structured

## Before vs After

### Before (Buggy):
```
Hover → Show → Flicker → Hide → Show → Flicker...
❌ Unusable
❌ Jittery
❌ Frustrating
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Hover → Show → [Stable] → Leave → [100ms] → Hide
✅ Smooth
✅ Stable
✅ Professional
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Rapid hovering:** Timeouts properly cancelled
2. **Quick clicks:** Immediate closure without delay
3. **Mouse jerks:** Debouncing prevents issues
4. **Popup transitions:** Smooth state management
5. **Component unmount:** Cleanup prevents leaks

## Files Changed

- `frontend/src/components/FreeMapView.js`
  - Added hover debouncing logic
  - Updated all hover handlers
