🎉 EVENT MARKERS AND DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOW VISIBLE!

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ WHAT WAS FIXED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BEFORE (Broken):
  ❌ Custom React div popup (didn't work with Leaflet)
  ❌ Fixed positioning outside map context
  ❌ Markers not clickable
  ❌ Descriptions not showing

AFTER (Working):
  ✅ Leaflet's built-in Popup component
  ✅ Properly integrated with map
  ✅ Markers are clickable
  ✅ Descriptions show perfectly

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 HOW IT WORKS NOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Event markers appear on map as colored pins
   • Different colors for different event types
   • Icon for each event type (🥾, ⛺, 🚴, etc.)

2. Click on any marker
   • Popup opens automatically
   • Shows full event details

3. Popup contains:
   ✅ Event title
   ✅ Event type badge
   ✅ Full description
   ✅ Location address
   ✅ Date & time
   ✅ Participant count
   ✅ Action buttons (Join/Leave/Delete/Chat)
